The functions used are : 

makeAuthenticate()
	The client program will initially send a message to the server that contains the data "AUTH secretpassword\n". This is done in this function.

clientAuthenticate()
	 Upon receiving the reply from the server, the client will parse the reply for the new port number on the server and the password. The client will then create a new connection with the server and then send the message "AUTH networks". The reply from the server is then parsed for the epoch time and the measurement. 

displayResult()
	The epoch time and the measurement are converted to human readable form and printed in this function.


NOTE *****
     The trace that has been attached has not used any filters. All other internet-connected applications were closed though. Thus, the first TCP packet is the one send from the client(from the given binary) to the server.
